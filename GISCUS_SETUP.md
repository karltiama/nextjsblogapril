# Giscus Comment System Setup

## What We've Implemented

✅ **CommentSection Component** - A reusable React component that integrates Giscus
✅ **Blog Post Integration** - Added comments to individual blog post pages
✅ **Basic Styling** - Comments section with proper spacing and typography
✅ **Test Scaffolding** - Basic test structure (needs Jest configuration fixes)

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Get GitHub Repository ID
Visit: https://api.github.com/repos/karltiama/nextjsblogapril
Look for the `"id"` field in the response and replace `REPLACE_WITH_REPO_ID` in `components/comment-section.tsx`

### 2. Get GitHub Category ID
Visit: https://api.github.com/repos/karltiama/nextjsblogapril/discussions/categories
Look for the `"id"` field for the "Announcements" category and replace `REPLACE_WITH_CATEGORY_ID`

### 3. Enable GitHub Discussions
- Go to your repository: https://github.com/karltiama/nextjsblogapril
- Click "Settings" tab
- Scroll down to "Features" section
- Enable "Discussions" checkbox
- Create an "Announcements" category if it doesn't exist

### 4. Test the Implementation
- Start your development server: `npm run dev`
- Visit any published blog post
- Scroll down to see the comments section
- Test commenting functionality

## How It Works

- **Giscus** creates GitHub Discussions for each blog post automatically
- Comments are tied to the post's URL path
- Users need GitHub accounts to comment
- All moderation happens through GitHub's built-in tools
- No database or backend required

## Features

- ✅ Real-time comments
- ✅ Markdown support in comments
- ✅ Threaded discussions
- ✅ GitHub notifications
- ✅ Moderation tools
- ✅ Dark/light theme support
- ✅ Mobile responsive

## Troubleshooting

If comments don't appear:
1. Check that GitHub Discussions are enabled
2. Verify repository and category IDs are correct
3. Ensure the blog post is published (`published: true`)
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
