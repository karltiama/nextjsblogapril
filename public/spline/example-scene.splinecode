// This is a placeholder file to demonstrate the local file method
// Replace this with your actual .splinecode file from Spline

// To use this method:
// 1. Export your Spline scene as .splinecode file
// 2. Replace this file with your actual scene file
// 3. Update the component to use: splineFile="/spline/example-scene.splinecode"

// The actual .splinecode file would contain binary data and be much larger
// This is just a placeholder to show the file structure
