# December Reflection

The last month of the year is here and I'm reflecting on the past year and looking forward to the next year. This last month I felt burnt out and stressed out. Maybe it was the holidays and the extra work that came with it, or maybe it was just the stress of the year piling up.
I took a break from personal projects and these last two weeks I been focusing on studying for my AWS Cloud Practioner Certification. The process has been going well and I found lost of study material that has been helpful.
I plan on writing a blog post about my experience studying for the exam and what I learned in the process.

I drifted away from my personal projects and didn't do much coding. I hope that this would give me a fresh mind to attack the new month and year coming up.
This is reflected on my github contributions. Overall Im pretty happy with my contributions this year. 
I still need to contribute to open source projects and grow my network in the developer community. However this year I focused most of my energy on my personal projects and learning new things.
I finished up my blog and added a lot of new content to it. I also finshed 3 projects.

One of which I features in this post. https://www.karltiama.dev/projects/enduro-stats
Enduro Stats was my first project that I completed and was a great learning experience. It was meant to help me display my running stats in a cool and interactive way.
Memory Mapper is some what finished but I need to clean up the code and finalize the features. The are some visual bugs that need to be fixed.
Reel Ratings is complete and functional, it was meant to be a project to learn about API integration and database modeling.

Overall the theme of my projects was API integration and backend development. I plan on continuing to work on these skills in the new year. I gained a lot of experience with Supabase and will be using it in my next projects.
