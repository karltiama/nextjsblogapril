# Project Title: Pokemon API

## Introduction

Project Overview: Interact and Display information with the Pokemon API
Objective: Get familiar with API and how to interact with them.

## Background

Motivation: I have always been interested in APIs and how they work. I have always wanted to learn how to interact with them and how to display the information in a user-friendly way. I have decided to start with the Pokemon API as it is a simple API to start with.
Prerequisites: Basic understanding of Next.js and React

## Planning and Set Up

Tools: Next.js, React, Pokemon API
Environment: Local

## Implementation

Steps: Set up next.js project, create a new component, fetch data from the Pokemon API, display the data in the component

```bash
npx create-next-app pokemon-api-app
```

Depending on the use case, there are many different ways to interact with an API.
We will start with the most basic way to interact with an API using the fetch API.
In this case we will creating a lib folder and a file called pokemon.ts.
This file will contain the logic to fetch the data from the Pokemon API.

```js showLineNumbers {2} {10}
export const getPokemonList = async () => {
	const response = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon");
	if (!response.ok) {
		throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
	}
	return response.json();
};

export const getPokemonDetails = async (name: string) => {
	const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name}`);
	if (!response.ok) {
		throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
	}
	return response.json();
};
```

Breaking down the code:

- We are using the fetch API to make a GET request to the Pokemon API.
- Each function is responsible for fetching a different type of data from the API.
- getPokemonList fetches a list of 20 Pokemon per the API documentation.
- We will fetch all the pokemon later on in the project.
- Marking the function as async allows us to use the await keyword to wait for the response.

## TO-DO

- Write about the PokeStats component
- Talk about isLoading and isError states
- Implementation of the PokemonList component
- Implementation of the PokemonDetails component

## Switching to Server-Side API routes

Key Benefits: Server-side API routes are useful when you need to fetch data at build time or request time.
This is useful when you need to fetch data that is not available at build time, such as user-specific data.
