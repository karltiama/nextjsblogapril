# Project Title: Pokemon API

## Introduction

Project Overview: Interact and Display information with the Pokemon API
Objective: Get familiar with API and how to interact with them.

## Background
Motivation: I have always been interested in APIs and how they work. I have always wanted to learn how to interact with them and how to display the information in a user-friendly way. I have decided to start with the Pokemon API as it is a simple API to start with.
Prerequisites: Basic understanding of Next.js and React

## Planning and Set Up
Tools: Next.js, React, Pokemon API
Environment: Local

## Implementation
Steps: Set up next.js project, create a new component, fetch data from the Pokemon API, display the data in the component


```bash
npx create-next-app pokemon-api-app
```

Depending on the use case, there are many different ways to interact with an API.
In this case we will creating a lib folder and a file called pokemon.ts.
This file will contain the logic to fetch the data from the Pokemon API.

```js
export const getPokemonList = async () => {
	const response = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon");
	if (!response.ok) {
		throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
	}
	return response.json();
};

export const getPokemonDetails = async (name: string) => {
	const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name}`);
	if (!response.ok) {
		throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
	}
	return response.json();
};
```
