# AWS Certification

This article is a summary of my journey to AWS Certification. I will be going through the process of getting certified and the resources I used to prepare for the exam. Hopefully this will help you on your journey to getting certified.

## Why AWS Certification?
I want to get certified because I want to prove my skills and knowledge in AWS. I also interested in learning more about cloud computing and AWS is the leading cloud platform. Ever since graduating from college I have been more and more curious
about what I can do with cloud computing. It has been the future of computing and I want to be a part of it.

## What Path to take for Certification?
I've done some research and found that the most popular path is skipping the Practitioner exam and going straight to the Associate level. This is because the Practitioner exam is more of a general overview of AWS and the Associate exam is more in depth.
However, I didn't take this path as I got a discount for the Practitioner exam and saw that there was a free re-take if I failed. I also wanted to get the Practioner exam out of the way as it would be a good baseline for the Associate exam.
