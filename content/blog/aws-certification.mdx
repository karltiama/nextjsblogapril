# AWS Certification

This article is a summary of my journey to AWS Certification. I will be going through the process of getting certified and the resources I used to prepare for the exam. Hopefully this will help you on your journey to getting certified.

## Why AWS Certification?
I want to get certified because I want to prove my skills and knowledge in AWS. I also interested in learning more about cloud computing and AWS is the leading cloud platform. Ever since graduating from college I have been more and more curious
about what I can do with cloud computing. It has been the future of computing and I want to be a part of it.

## What Path to take for Certification?
I've done some research and found that the most popular path is skipping the Practitioner exam and going straight to the Associate level. This is because the Practitioner exam is more of a general overview of AWS and the Associate exam is more in depth.
However, I didn't take this path as I got a discount for the Practitioner exam and saw that there was a free re-take if I failed. I also wanted to get the Practioner exam out of the way as it would be a good baseline for the Associate exam. Generally if
you have a background in IT, you can skip the Practitioner exam and go straight to the Associate exam.

## How to Prepare for the exam

I used the following resources to prepare for the exam:

[AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/), this link will take you to the official documentation for the exam. Amazon provides a couple of free resources to help you prepare for the exam.
I am going to separate the resources into two sections, free and paid.

### Free Resources

- [AWS Certification Practice Exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/practice/)
- [freeCodeCamp Youtube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhDYbskXRgc&pp=ygUVY2xvdWQgcHJhY3Rpb25lciBleGFt)

Both are great resources to help you for the exam. I personally used freeCodeCamp as it was a good overview of the exam and the practice exam was a good way to test my knowledge.

### Paid Resources

The only paid resource I used was practice exams from [Stephane Maarek - Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner)
This course comes with 6 practice exams and what I liked about this course was that it has two different types of exams. The first type was exam mode which was a simulation of the real exam.
Then the second type was practice mode where you could go question by question and get immediate feedback on your answers. I found this to be a great way to prepare for the exam as it helped me understand the topics that I needed to focus on.
