# My Spline Learning Journey: From 403 Errors to Interactive 3D Scenes

## Introduction

When I first discovered Spline, I was immediately captivated by the
idea of creating interactive 3D scenes directly in the browser. The
promise of drag-and-drop 3D design that could be embedded into any
React application seemed too good to be true. Spoiler alert: it
wasn't, but the journey to get there was filled with more challenges
than I initially anticipated.

In this post, I'll walk you through my complete learning journey with
Spline, from the initial excitement to the frustrating 403 errors,
through the debugging process, and finally to a working
implementation. Whether you're just starting with Spline or hitting
similar roadblocks, I hope this story helps you navigate your own 3D
web development adventure.

## The Initial Vision

### What I Wanted to Build

I was browsing some GitHub repos when I stumbled upon Medusa, which is a
digital commerce platform with a built-in framework for customization.
I came across their homepage and saw a beautiful animation that I knew
I had to learn how to recreate. I sat at their page mesmerized by how
elegant this animation was, a floating 5-layer interactive UI stacked
vertically representing 5 different layers of their framework.
As you hover over each layer, the top layer would fade to an opaque state
and reveal the next layer underneath. You can check out the animation yourself if
you'd [like](https://medusajs.com/).

This interactive layering effect was exactly what I wanted to build, but
I needed to figure out the best way to implement it in a React application. 




### Why Spline?

I chose Spline for several reasons:

- **Visual Design**: The ability to design 3D scenes visually rather
  than coding everything from scratch
- **React Integration**: Native React components with
  `@splinetool/react-spline`
- **Performance**: Optimized WebGL rendering out of the box
- **Ease of Use**: Promised to be beginner-friendly for 3D development

## The First Hurdle: Understanding the Export Options

### URL vs Local File Confusion

One of my first challenges was understanding the different ways to
integrate Spline scenes:

**URL Method:**

- Export scene as React component
- Get a public URL (e.g.,
  `https://prod.spline.design/.../scene.splinecode`)
- Load directly in React component
- Pros: Simple, no file management
- Cons: Requires public scene, dependent on Spline's servers

**Local File Method:**

- Export as self-hosted `.splinecode` file
- Host the file in your own `public/` directory
- Load from local file system
- Pros: Full control, no external dependencies
- Cons: Requires paid Spline plan, larger bundle size

### The Decision Process

I initially wanted to try both methods to compare them, but quickly
realized the local file approach required a paid subscription. This
led me to focus on the URL method, which turned out to be the right
choice for my use case.

## The Debugging Nightmare

### Error #1: 403 Forbidden

The first major roadblock was a 403 error when trying to load my
scene. This taught me several important lessons:

```javascript
// What I learned about Spline URLs
const splineUrl =
	"https://prod.spline.design/0tc5vcx8upINop77/scene.splinecode";
// ‚úÖ Correct format
// ‚ùå https://my.spline.design/... (wrong subdomain)
```

**Key Learnings:**

- Always use `prod.spline.design` for public scenes
- Ensure your scene is set to "Public" in Spline
- The URL format is very specific and case-sensitive

### Error #2: "Data read, but end of buffer not reached"

This cryptic error was particularly frustrating because it provided no
clear solution path. Through extensive debugging, I discovered:

- The error often indicates a corrupted or invalid scene file
- Sometimes it's a network issue where the file isn't fully downloaded
- Re-exporting the scene from Spline usually fixes it

### Error #3: Infinite Loading States

The most user-unfriendly issue was scenes that would load forever
without any error feedback. This led me to implement:

```javascript
// Loading timeout with user control
useEffect(() => {
	const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
		if (!isLoaded && !error) {
			setTimeoutReached(true);
			setError("Loading timeout - check URL and scene settings");
		}
	}, 8000); // 8 second timeout

	return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
}, [isLoaded, error]);
```

## The Technical Deep Dive

### Next.js Integration Challenges

Working with Spline in Next.js presented several unique challenges:

**Client-Side Rendering Issues:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå This caused hydration errors
export default function SplineComponent() {
  return <Spline scene={url} />
}

// ‚úÖ This works with proper client-side handling
'use client'
export default function SplineComponent() {
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true)
  }, [])

  if (!isClient) return <div>Loading...</div>

  return <Spline scene={url} />
}
```

**Module Resolution Problems:** The `@splinetool/react-spline` package
had some export issues that required careful import handling:

```javascript
// ‚ùå This caused module resolution errors
import Spline from "@splinetool/react-spline/next";

// ‚úÖ This worked reliably
import Spline from "@splinetool/react-spline";
```

### Building a Robust Component

Through trial and error, I developed a robust Spline component that
handles all the edge cases:

```javascript
export default function SplineBasic({ splineUrl }: SplineBasicProps) {
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)
  const [timeoutReached, setTimeoutReached] = useState(false)
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)

  // Client-side rendering check
  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true)
  }, [])

  // Loading timeout
  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      if (!isLoaded && !error) {
        setTimeoutReached(true)
        setError('Loading timeout - check URL and scene settings')
      }
    }, 8000)

    return () => clearTimeout(timeout)
  }, [isLoaded, error])

  const onLoad = (splineApp: any) => {
    setIsLoaded(true)
    setError(null)
    console.log('Spline scene loaded successfully!')

    // Test object detection
    if (splineApp && splineApp.findObjectByName) {
      const testObjects = ['Monitor', 'UI', 'Puzzle', 'Framework', 'Cloud']
      testObjects.forEach(name => {
        const obj = splineApp.findObjectByName(name)
        console.log(`Object "${name}":`, obj ? 'Found' : 'Not found')
      })
    }
  }

  const onError = (error: any) => {
    console.error('Spline loading error:', error)
    let errorMessage = 'Failed to load scene'

    if (error.message && error.message.includes('Unexpected token')) {
      errorMessage = 'Invalid scene format - check URL and scene settings'
    } else if (error.message) {
      errorMessage = `Failed to load scene: ${error.message}`
    }

    setError(errorMessage)
  }

  // Rest of component...
}
```

## The Animation Challenge

### Understanding Spline's Animation System

One of the most complex parts was figuring out how to control Spline
animations from React:

**Spline Actions vs Direct Object Manipulation:**

- Spline Actions: Built-in system for scene interactions
- Direct Manipulation: Accessing objects via `findObjectByName()` and
  modifying properties

**The OverlayViel Problem:** My original vision required hiding the
opacity layer initially, but Spline's free Actions don't include a
"Hide Object" action. This led to a fundamental decision:

1. Use Spline Actions (limited but integrated)
2. Use direct object manipulation (more control but more complex)

### The Viewport Interaction Approach

I experimented with direct viewport interaction using Spline's native
event system:

```javascript
// Setting up hover events directly in Spline viewport
layer.addEventListener("mouseHover", () => {
	console.log(`Hovered over ${layerName} in viewport`);
	handleLayerHover(index);
});

layer.addEventListener("mouseLeave", () => {
	console.log(`Left ${layerName} in viewport`);
	handleLayerLeave();
});
```

This approach worked but required careful coordination between
Spline's event system and React's state management.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Step-by-Step Approach**: Starting with basic rendering before
   adding complex features
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Timeouts, user feedback, and
   detailed error messages
3. **Debugging Tools**: URL testing component to verify scene
   accessibility
4. **Client-Side Rendering**: Proper handling of Next.js SSR
   requirements

### What Was Challenging

1. **Documentation Gaps**: Limited examples for complex integration
   scenarios
2. **Error Messages**: Cryptic errors that didn't provide clear
   solutions
3. **Animation Control**: Limited options for fine-grained animation
   control
4. **State Management**: Coordinating between Spline's internal state
   and React state

### Key Insights

1. **Start Simple**: Get basic rendering working before adding
   animations
2. **Plan for Errors**: Users will hit the same issues you do
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Different browsers and devices can behave
   differently
4. **Document Everything**: You'll forget the solutions to problems
   you've already solved

## The Current State

## Code Examples and Resources

### Essential Spline Component

```javascript
'use client'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import Spline from '@splinetool/react-spline'

interface SplineBasicProps {
  splineUrl: string
}

export default function SplineBasic({ splineUrl }: SplineBasicProps) {
  // Component implementation as shown above
}
```

### Debugging URL Component

```javascript
export default function UrlTest({ url }: { url: string }) {
  const [response, setResponse] = useState<string>('')
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)

  const testUrl = async () => {
    setLoading(true)
    setError(null)

    try {
      const res = await fetch(url)
      const text = await res.text()
      setResponse(text.substring(0, 500) + '...')
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Unknown error')
    } finally {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="bg-slate-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
      <button onClick={testUrl} disabled={loading}>
        {loading ? 'Testing...' : 'Test URL'}
      </button>
      {error && <div className="text-red-400 mt-2">Error: {error}</div>}
      {response && <pre className="text-xs mt-2">{response}</pre>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

My Spline learning journey was filled with both excitement and
frustration, but ultimately it was incredibly rewarding. The key was
persistence, systematic debugging, and not being afraid to simplify
when things got too complex.

The most important lesson I learned is that 3D web development, even
with tools as powerful as Spline, still requires a solid understanding
of the underlying technologies. Spline makes it easier, but it doesn't
eliminate the need for proper error handling, state management, and
performance considerations.

If you're starting your own Spline journey, I'd recommend:

1. Start with the basics - get a simple scene rendering first
2. Build robust error handling from the beginning
3. Don't be afraid to simplify your initial vision
4. Document everything as you learn
5. Be patient with the debugging process

The 3D web is an exciting frontier, and tools like Spline are making
it more accessible than ever. With the right approach and persistence,
you can create amazing interactive experiences that were impossible
just a few years ago.
