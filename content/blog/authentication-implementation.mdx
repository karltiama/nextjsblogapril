## Deep Dive: Authentication Implementation (In Progress)

The first step in transforming Enduro Stats was implementing proper
authentication. Without it, we couldn't safely store user data or provide
personalized analytics. Here's how we tackled it:

1. **User Authentication Flow**:
   - Implemented email/password authentication using Supabase Auth
   - Added social login options for better user experience
   - Set up proper session management with refresh tokens

2. **Strava OAuth Integration**:
   - Implemented the full OAuth 2.0 flow with PKCE
   - Securely stored refresh tokens for background syncs
   - Added token rotation and automatic refresh handling

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Implemented proper CSRF protection
   - Added rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Set up secure session cookie handling

## Building the Foundation: Data Layer

With secure authentication in place, we focused on the core challenge: data
persistence and management. Our data layer needed to handle:

1. **Activity Data**:
   - Raw activity data from Strava
   - Derived metrics and analytics
   - User-specific customizations and notes

2. **User Preferences**:
   - Training zones and thresholds
   - Display preferences
   - Notification settings

3. **Analytics Data**:
   - Historical performance metrics
   - Training load calculations
   - Progress tracking
