# My Tech Stack

## Frameworks

- Next.js
- React

When I first started learning React about 5 years ago I began learning with class components. Then I switched to the more modern functional components. Personally, I think functional components are easier to understand and use and
I am glad that modern React has added hooks to make functional components more powerful. Along with React, I also use Next.js, I love the routing system and the ability to prefetch pages.
Also Next.js projects are easy to deploy via vercel. Now it is immportant to mention that not one of these technologies is the best, it really depends on the project you are working on.
There are many other frameworks and libraries that I could mention, but these are the ones I use the most.

## Front End
