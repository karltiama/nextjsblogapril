## Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of web development, tools and libraries are constantly being developed
to make the process easier and more efficient. With the growing demand for highly customizable
and accessible user interfaces, libraries like **shadcn UI** have emerged as standouts in the field.

**shadcn UI** is a collection of React components designed with customization and accessibility
in mind. Before we dive into the features of shadcn UI, let's first explore the library that powers it:
**Radix UI**.

## Understanding Radix UI Primitives

Radix UI Primitives is a collection of low-level, unstyled UI components designed to be highly composable and accessible. These components serve as the foundation for shadcn UI, providing a solid base for building complex user interfaces.

Key features of Radix UI Primitives:

- They adhere to WAI-ARIA guidelines, ensuring web content is more accessible to people with disabilities.
- They are designed as building blocks for more complex UI components, which is exactly how shadcn UI utilizes them.
- They handle complex interactions and accessibility concerns, allowing developers to focus on styling and customization.

## Introducing shadcn UI
shadcn UI builds upon Radix UI Primitives by:

- Utilizing Radix components as a base for functionality and accessibility.
- Applying carefully crafted Tailwind CSS classes for styling, instead of custom CSS.
- Providing a collection of pre-built, customizable components that you can copy directly into your project.

It's worth noting that shadcn UI doesn't use the `clsx` library directly. Instead, it typically uses a custom `cn` utility function (often built with the `clsx` or `tailwind-merge` libraries) for conditional class merging.

The components themselves are highly customizable and can be easily styled using tailwind classes. Unlike other UI libraries, shadcn UI components are meant to be
used as building blocks for your own components and copied directly into your project.

The shadcn/ui documentation is a great resource. It provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the components, as well as examples and best practices.
