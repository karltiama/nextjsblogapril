# A Deep Dive into shadcn UI

In the ever-evolving world of web development, tools and libraries are constantly being developed
to make the process easier and more efficient. With the growing demand for highly customizable
and accessible user interfaces, libraries like **shadcn UI** have emerged as standouts in the field.

**shadcn UI** is a collection of React components designed with customization and accessibility
in mind. Before we dive into the features of shadcn UI, let's first explore the library that powers it:
**Radix UI**.

# Radix UI: The Foundation of shadcn UI

Radix UI is a collection of low-level UI components that are designed to be highly composable and accessible.
These components serve as the foundation for shadcn UI, providing a solid base for building complex user interfaces.

### Key Features of Radix UI

1. **Accessible by Default**: Radix UI primitives come with built-in accessibility features,
   ensuring that your components meet web standards right out of the box.
2. **Unstyled Primitives**: Unlike other UI libraries that come pre-styled, Radix UI focuses
   on providing unstyled components, allowing you to apply your own design system.
3. **Highly Customizable**: With unstyled components, Radix UI gives you the flexibility to
   create complex, custom interfaces while handling the accessibility and interaction logic for you.

### Example: Creating a Dialog with Radix UI

One of the most common components in web apps is the **dialog** (or modal). Here's a simple
example of how to implement a dialog using Radix UI:

```tsx
import * as Dialog from "@radix-ui/react-dialog";

function App() {
	return (
		<Dialog.Root>
			<Dialog.Trigger asChild>
				<button>Open Dialog</button>
			</Dialog.Trigger>
			<Dialog.Portal>
				<Dialog.Overlay />
				<Dialog.Content>
					<Dialog.Title>Radix Dialog</Dialog.Title>
					<Dialog.Description>
						This is an accessible dialog component.
					</Dialog.Description>
					<Dialog.Close asChild>
						<button>Close</button>
					</Dialog.Close>
				</Dialog.Content>
			</Dialog.Portal>
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
}
```
