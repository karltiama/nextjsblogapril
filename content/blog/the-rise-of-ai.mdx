## My thoughts on AI

This day and age, so many companies are leveraging AI to improve their products and services. It's a big selling point of many products and services.
However, I think it's just as important to understand how to utilize it effectively. It's not just about having the technology, but knowing how to use it to its full potential.
With new versions of AI being released every day, I think its not as important to keep up with the latest trends, but to understand the core concepts and how they can be applied in any situation.
Don't let AI be end all be all, but rather a tool to help you achieve your goals. AI is the vehicle, but you are the driver.

We live in the digital age, where data is everywhere. Using AI as a tool and cross referencing to different sources of information can help you make better decisions.
