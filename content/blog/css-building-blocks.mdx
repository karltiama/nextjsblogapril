# Back to Basics: CSS Building Blocks

Regardless of what CSS framework you use, understanding the core concepts of CSS is essential
for building robust and maintainable web pages. In this article, we'll review the foundational
building blocks of CSS: the box model, display property, and positioning. By mastering these
concepts, you'll be better equipped to create beautiful and responsive designs for your web projects.

## The Box Model

The foundation of CSS styling is the box model, which defines how elements are rendered on the page.
Each element is treated as a rectangular box with four distinct areas: content, padding, border, and margin.

## Display Property

The outer display values control the layout of the element itself. The most common outer display values are
`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and `none`.

- Block boxes and inline boxes are the two main types of boxes in CSS. To set the display
  property of an element to block or inline, you can use the `display` property.
- Think block elements as taking up the full width of the page and starting on a new line,
  while inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.
- I like to think Block elements as paragraphs and inline elements as words.
- Block elements can have width, height, margin, padding, and border properties applied to them.
- Inline elements can only have margin, padding, and border applied to them.
- Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, but they can have width, height, margin, padding, and border applied to them.
- None hides the element from the page and used with assitive technologies like screen readers.

## Logical properties

Logical properties are a way to write CSS that is independent of the direction of the text. Instead of using
`top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`, you can use `block-start`, `block-end`, `inline-start`, and `inline-end`.

## Formatting Contexts

Applying display: flex or display: grid to a container creates a new formatting context.
This means that the container and its children are laid out according to the rules of the flexbox or
grid layout, rather than the normal flow of the document. It continues to behave as a block-level element, but
the children are laid out as flex items or grid items.

Without intervention it is the contents of an element that determines its size and shape. Inline conent will
grow hozizontally and block content will grow vertically.

## The Box-Sizing Property

Default box-sizing is the content-box, which means that the dimensions of the box's content plus its padding
and border values. The border-box value includes the padding and border values in the box's dimensions.

Generally, its considered best practice to use the border-box value for the box-sizing property, as it makes
it easier to calculate the size of elements and ensures that the padding and border values do not affect the
overall dimensions of the box.

Some exceptions
Dimensions of elements should be largely derived from their inner and outer context. Instead of telling browsers
what to do, we allow them to make their own decisions, to best suit the user, their screen and device.

## Composition and Layout

Combining simple independent parts gives you more flexibility and control over the layout of your page.
We need to identify and document which each of these smaller layouts are, and call them primitives.

## Units

## Global and local styling

## The Stack

- Problem: flow elements require white space, to physically and conceptually separate them. This is the purpose of
  margin property. In design systems we dont know wheather there will be surrounding content or what nature of that
  context will be. Margin is the relationship between the element and its context. Adding margin to a global element
  may not be the right thing to do.
- Solution: Style the context, not the individual elements. Inject margins between elements via the common parent.

## The Box

- Box's role within the layout system is to take care of any styles that can be considered intrinsic to individual
  elements, styles which are not dictaed inherited or inferred form the meta-layouts to which an individual elemennt
  may be subjected.

If you don't have anything to put in a a box you, dont need a box. I fyou do have somethign in a box, the best box
is the one with just enough room and no more. Padding should be a box styling option. The box element should have
all padding on all sides or no sides at all.

The visible box, the box should you either border or a background.

Use cases for the box element:

- group and demarcate content

Examples

- A box within a Stack
- box with a header

## The Cluster

Use cases for Cluster components:

- Any group of elements that differ in length and are liable to wrap.
- Buttons that appear together at the end of form, as well as tags, keywords or other metadata.
- Align any groups of horizaontally laid out elements to the left, right or center.
- List of items that need to be separated by a small amount of space.
