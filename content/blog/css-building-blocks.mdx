# Back to Basics: CSS Building Blocks

Regardless of what CSS framework you use, understanding the core concepts of CSS is essential
for building robust and maintainable web pages. In this article, we'll review the foundational
building blocks of CSS: the box model, display property, and positioning. By mastering these 
concepts, you'll be better equipped to create beautiful and responsive designs for your web projects.

## The Box Model

The foundation of CSS styling is the box model, which defines how elements are rendered on the page.
Each element is treated as a rectangular box with four distinct areas: content, padding, border, and margin.

# Display Property

## Block and inline boxes

Block boxes and inline boxes are the two main types of boxes in CSS. To set the display property of an element to block or inline, you can use the `display` property.

## Outer display values

The outer display values control the layout of the element itself. The most common outer display values are `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and `none`.

## Inner display values

Inner display dictates how elements inside that box are laid out. The most common inner display values are `flow`, `flow-root`, `table`, `flex`, and `grid`.
