Object Destructuring is a common practice in JavaScript. It allows you to extract multiple properties from an object and assign them to variables. This can make your code cleaner and more readable.

```js
const person = {
	name: "John Doe",
	age: 30,
	location: "New York",
};

const { name, age, location } = person;

console.log(name); // John Doe

// With out Destructuring

const name = person.name;
const age = person.age;
const location = person.location;

console.log(name); // John Doe
```

Utility functions I use in my projects:

```js
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
	return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

This cn function is a utility function that I use in my projects.
It takes an array of class names and merges them into a single string.
This can be useful when you want to conditionally apply classes to an element.

It takes a rest parameter ...inputs of type ClassValue[].

Quick Knowledge Check:
What is a rest parameter in JavaScript?

It allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

Here is an example:

```js
function sum(...numbers) {
	return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Outputs: 10
```
