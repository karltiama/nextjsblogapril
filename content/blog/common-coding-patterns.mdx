Object Destructuring is a common practice in JavaScript. It allows you to extract multiple properties from an object and assign them to variables. This can make your code cleaner and more readable.

```js
const person = {
	name: "John Doe",
	age: 30,
	location: "New York",
};

const { name, age, location } = person;

console.log(name); // John Doe

// With out Destructuring

const name = person.name;
const age = person.age;
const location = person.location;

console.log(name); // John Doe
```

Utility functions I use in my projects:

```js
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
	return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

This cn function is a utility function that I use in my projects.
It takes an array of class names and merges them into a single string.
This can be useful when you want to conditionally apply classes to an element.

It takes a rest parameter ...inputs of type ClassValue[].

Quick Knowledge Check:
What is a rest parameter in JavaScript?

It allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

Here is an example:

```js
function sum(...numbers) {
	return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Outputs: 10
```

The cn function allows you to conditionally apply class names based on certain conditions.
It combines the clsx and twMerge functions to merge the class names into a single string.

Here is a breakdown of the function:

1. Base Class: The base class is the default class that you want to apply to an element.
2. Conditional Classes: The conditional classes are additional classes that you want to apply based on certain conditions.

Example Usage:

```js
import React from "react";
import { cn } from "./utils";

const MyButton: React.FC<{ isActive: boolean, isDisabled: boolean }> = ({
	isActive,
	isDisabled,
}) => {
	return (
		<button
			className={cn(
				"base-class", // Always applied
				isActive && "active-class", // Applied if isActive is true
				isDisabled && "disabled-class" // Applied if isDisabled is true
			)}
			disabled={isDisabled}>
			Click Me
		</button>
	);
};

export default MyButton;
```

Explanation:

- Base class: 'base-class' is always applied to the button element.
- Conditional Classes: 'active-class' is applied if isActive is true, and 'disabled-class' is applied if isDisabled is true.

The cn function uses clsx to conditional combine these class names and twMerge to handle any potential conflicts or dupilications specific to Tailwind CSS.

This is a simple example of how you can use the cn function to conditionally apply classes to an element in a React component.
