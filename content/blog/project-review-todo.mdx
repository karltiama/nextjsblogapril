# Project Title: Full Stack Todo Website

## Introduction

Project Overview: Create a full stack todo app using Next.js, Prisma, and
Supabase Objective: Familiarize myself of the workflow of creating a full stack
application using Next.js, Prisma, and Supabase.

## Background

Motivation: I want to practice my back-end skills and learn how to use Prisma
and Supabase to create a full stack application. I have decided to create a todo
app as it is a simple application that can be expanded with more features. I
have a background in database schema design and SQL, so I am excited to see how
Prisma can help me interact with the database

## Planning

Tools: Next.js, Prisma, Supabase

## Implementation

This project will be divided into two parts: the front-end and the back-end.
Lets start with the back-end. Every good project starts with a good plan. I will
start by creating a database schema for the todo app. I will then create a
Prisma schema based on the database schema. I will then create the API routes to
interact with the database using Prisma.

Understanding and Designing the Database Schema

1. Identify Key Entities: Users, Todos and Notes?
2. Define Attributes for each entity

- Users: id, email, name, password
- Todos: id, title, description, due_date, status, created_at, updated_at,
  user_id
- Notes?: id, content, created_at, updated_at, todo_id, user_id,

3. Define Relationships between Entities

- Users have many Todos
- Each todo can have multiple Notes

4. Constraints

- Users: email should be unique

Rationale:

- Normalization
- Data Integrity
- Scalability
- Performance

I spent probably too much time on the database schema design, but I think it is
important to have a good foundation before starting the implementation. The over
research allowed me to really dive deep in to the database schema design and
understand the relationships between the entities.

I also spent some time researching how to use Prisma and Supabase. I found some
forum post and questions that actually don't recomend Prisma. The main reasoning
behind usiny Prisma is that it is a type-safe database client that can be used
with TypeScript. It also has a lot of features that can help me interact with
the database easily. But I also was digging into the Supabase documentation and
saw that Supabase supports TypeScript and has a lot of features that can help me
interact with the database easily.

Supabase CLI can be used to generate TypeScript types for the database schema.
This is a feature that I really like as it can help me catch errors at compile
time. So instead of using Prisma, I decided to use Supabase solely for this
project.
