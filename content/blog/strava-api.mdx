# Interacting with the Strava API

Strava is a popular platform for tracking and sharing fitness activities, ranging from running and cycling to swimming and hiking.
If you're a fitness enthusiast or a developer looking to integrate fitness data into your applications, the Strava API provides a wealth of information to explore.

The Strava REST API includes data on athelete, segments, routes, clubs and gear.

In this beginner's guide, we'll walk through the process of interacting with the Strava API using OAuth 2.0 authentication.
By the end of this guide, you'll be able to access your fitness data and build cool applications that enhance your workout experience.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the Strava API, you'll need to have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Strava account: Sign up for a Strava account if you don't have one already.
- A Strava API application: Register a new application on the Strava developers portal to obtain your client ID and client secret.
- A basic understanding of OAuth 2.0: Familiarize yourself with the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework, which is used to authenticate and authorize users in API requests.

Here is a quick overview of the OAuth 2.0:

OAuth is an authorization framework that allows 3rd party applications to obtain limmited access to an HTTP service on behalf of a

Key Roles in OAuth 2.0:

- Resource Owner: The user who owns the data and grants access to the client.
- Client: The application requesting access to the user's data.
- Authorization Server: The server that authenticates the user and issues access tokens.
- Resource Server: The server hosting the protected resources that the client wants to access.

Key Concepts in OAuth 2.0:

- Authorization Grant: A credential representing the resource owner's authorization to access protected resources.
- Access Token: A credential used by the client to access protected resources on behalf of the user.
- Refresh Token: A credential used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.

OAuth 2.0 Flows:

- Authorization Code Grant: Used by web applications to access user data on behalf of the user.

- Implicit Grant: Used by single-page applications and mobile apps to access user data on behalf of the user.

- Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant: Used by trusted applications to access user data with the user's username and password.

- Client Credentials Grant: Used by applications to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user.

For more information on OAuth 2.0, check out the [OAuth 2.0 RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).

When learning how to interact with the Strava API its important to understand the flow of the OAuth 2.0 authorization process.
When I first started learning about OAuth 2.0, I found the concept of authorization flows to be a bit confusing.

A quick over of the steps in the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow:

1. Redirect the user to the authorization server.
2. The user logs in and grants permission to the client.
3. Strava Redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code.
4. The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
5. The client uses the access token to make API requests on behalf of the user.

# Getting Started with the Strava API

Now that you have the prerequisites in place, let's get started with the Strava API.
The first step is to create a new Strava API application on the Strava developers portal.

Here are the steps to create a new Strava API application:

- Log in to the Strava developers portal using your Strava account credentials.
- Click on the "Create & Manage Your App" button to create a new application.
- Fill in the required details for your application, including the name, description, website, and authorization callback domain.
- Once you've created the application, you'll receive your client ID and client secret, which are required for authenticating with the Strava API.
- Make sure to note down your client ID and client secret, as you'll need them later in the guide.
- In this guide we will be using Next.js to build a simple web application that interacts with the Strava API.
- Next.js is a popular React framework that makes it easy to build server-side rendered applications with React.
- To get started, create a new Next.js project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app strava-api-app
```

When first setting up Next.js, you will be prompted to choose a template for your project.

```bash
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

We will be using TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind, the source directory and App Router we will keeping the default import alias

The documentation for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) is great place to read about more configurations

## Background in Routing with Next.js

Always remember that using multiple sources of truths when learning a new technology is the best way to
learn. The Next.js documentation is a great place to start when learning about the framework.

Next.js uses a file-system based routing system, we will be using App Router which is a recommended routing system for Next.js.
Each subdirectory of the app directory becomes a route when having a page.tsx file associated with it.

[Next.js Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)
Route Handlers are functions that can be used to handle requests to a specific route using web request and response APIs.

## Project Flow

First we have to make an environment file to store our Strava API credentials and save it as .env.local in the root of the project.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI=
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=
STRAVA_SECRET=
STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN=
```

Our first task is to create a link that will redirect the user to the Strava authorization page.
When the user clicks on the link, they will be redirected to the Strava authorization page where they can grant permission to the client application.

```
https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID}&response_type=code&redirect_uri=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI}&approval_prompt=force&scope=read,activity:read,activity:read_all`;
```

`approval_prompt=force&scope=read,activity:read,activity:read_all` is used to force the user to grant permission to the client application and specify the scopes of access to the user's data.

Breaking down the URL:

Redirect the user to the base URL with GET https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize

- client_id: The client ID of the Strava API application.
- redirect_uri: The redirect URI where the user will be redirected after granting permission.
- response_type: The type of response expected from the authorization server (code for the Authorization Code Grant flow).
- approval_prompt: Force the user to grant permission to the client application.
- scope: The scopes of access to the user's data (read, activity:read, activity:read_all).

Once the user grants permission to the client application, they will be redirected back to the redirect URI with an authorization code.

This is where the client application exchanges the authorization code for an access token to make API requests on behalf of the user.

_TO DO BASIC PAGE WITH LINK TO STRAVA AUTHORIZATION PAGE_

The next step is to create a new page in the pages directory of the Next.js project to handle the authorization callback.

Create a new file called 'route.ts' in the 'api/strava/callback directory'.
In this file, we'll extract the authorization code from the query parameters and exchange it for an access token.

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
	const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url);
	const code = searchParams.get("code");

	if (!code) {
		return NextResponse.json({ error: "Missing code" }, { status: 400 });
	}

	const headers: HeadersInit = {
		Accept: "application/json, text/plain, */*",
		"Content-Type": "application/json",
	};

	const body = JSON.stringify({
		client_id: process.env.STRAVA_CLIENT_ID,
		client_secret: process.env.STRAVA_SECRET,
		code: code,
		grant_type: "authorization_code",
	});

	const response = await fetch("https://www.strava.com/oauth/token", {
		method: "POST",
		headers: headers,
		body: body,
	});

	if (!response.ok) {
		const errorResponse = await response.json();
		return NextResponse.json(
			{ error: "Failed to get access token", details: errorResponse },
			{ status: response.status }
		);
	}

	const tokenData = await response.json();
	const accessToken = tokenData.access_token; // Save the access token

	// Create a NextResponse object and set the cookie
	const redirectUrl = new URL("/strava/success", req.url).toString();
	const nextResponse = NextResponse.redirect(redirectUrl);

	// Set the cookie in the NextResponse object
	nextResponse.cookies.set("accessToken", accessToken, {
		httpOnly: true,
		secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production", // only set secure in production
		path: "/",
	});

	return nextResponse;
}

export function getAccessToken(req: NextRequest) {
	return req.cookies.get("accessToken");
}
```

In this code, we define two functions: GET and getAccessToken to implement server-side logic using Next.js.

The 'GET' function handles incoming GET requests to the '/api/strava/callback' route. It extracts the query parameter named 'code' from the URL.
If the code is missing, it returns a 400 Bad Request response with an error message.

If the code parameter is present, headers and body are defined for the POST request to the Strava API token endpoint.
For error handling, we check if the response is not ok and return a JSON response with the error details.
When a POST request is successful in getting the access token, we extract the access token from the response data and save it.
Then we create a redirect URL to the '/strava/success' route and set the access token as a cookie in the NextResponse object.

The getAccessToken function is used to retrieve the access token from the cookie in the request object.

## Handling the Success Route

Create a new file in the 'app/strava/success' directory called 'pages.tsx' to handle the success route.
