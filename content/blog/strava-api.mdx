# Interacting with the Strava API

Strava is a popular platform for tracking and sharing fitness activities, ranging from running and cycling to swimming and hiking.
If you're a fitness enthusiast or a developer looking to integrate fitness data into your applications, the Strava API provides a wealth of information to explore.

The Strava REST API includes data on athelete, segments, routes, clubs and gear.

In this beginner's guide, we'll walk through the process of interacting with the Strava API using OAuth 2.0 authentication.
By the end of this guide, you'll be able to access your fitness data and build cool applications that enhance your workout experience.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the Strava API, you'll need to have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Strava account: Sign up for a Strava account if you don't have one already.
- A Strava API application: Register a new application on the Strava developers portal to obtain your client ID and client secret.
- A basic understanding of OAuth 2.0: Familiarize yourself with the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework, which is used to authenticate and authorize users in API requests.

Here is a quick overview of the OAuth 2.0:

OAuth is an authorization framework that allows 3rd party applications to obtain limmited access to an HTTP service on behalf of a

Key Roles in OAuth 2.0:

- Resource Owner: The user who owns the data and grants access to the client.
- Client: The application requesting access to the user's data.
- Authorization Server: The server that authenticates the user and issues access tokens.
- Resource Server: The server hosting the protected resources that the client wants to access.

Key Concepts in OAuth 2.0:

- Authorization Grant: A credential representing the resource owner's authorization to access protected resources.
- Access Token: A credential used by the client to access protected resources on behalf of the user.
- Refresh Token: A credential used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.

OAuth 2.0 Flows:

- Authorization Code Grant: Used by web applications to access user data on behalf of the user.

- Implicit Grant: Used by single-page applications and mobile apps to access user data on behalf of the user.

- Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant: Used by trusted applications to access user data with the user's username and password.

- Client Credentials Grant: Used by applications to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user.

For more information on OAuth 2.0, check out the [OAuth 2.0 RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).

When learning how to interact with the Strava API its important to understand the flow of the OAuth 2.0 authorization process.
When I first started learning about OAuth 2.0, I found the concept of authorization flows to be a bit confusing.

A quick over of the steps in the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow:

1. Redirect the user to the authorization server.
2. The user logs in and grants permission to the client.
3. Strava Redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code.
4. The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
5. The client uses the access token to make API requests on behalf of the user.

# Getting Started with the Strava API

Now that you have the prerequisites in place, let's get started with the Strava API.
The first step is to create a new Strava API application on the Strava developers portal.

Here are the steps to create a new Strava API application:

- Log in to the Strava developers portal using your Strava account credentials.
- Click on the "Create & Manage Your App" button to create a new application.
- Fill in the required details for your application, including the name, description, website, and authorization callback domain.
- Once you've created the application, you'll receive your client ID and client secret, which are required for authenticating with the Strava API.
- In this guide we will be using Next.js to build a simple web application that interacts with the Strava API.
- Next.js is a popular React framework that makes it easy to build server-side rendered applications with React.
- To get started, create a new Next.js project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app strava-api-app
```

When first setting up Next.js, you will be prompted to choose a template for your project.

```bash
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

We will be using TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind, the source directory and App Router we will keeping the default import alias

The doc for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) is great place to read about more configurations and

## Background in Routing with Next.js

Next.js uses a file-system based routing system, we will be using App Router which is a recommended routing system for Next.js.
Each subdirectory of the app directory becomes a route when having a page.tsx file associated with it.
