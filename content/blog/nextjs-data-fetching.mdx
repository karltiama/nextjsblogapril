# Fetching Data with Next.js

Next.js offers a variety of powerful data fetching methods, each tailored to specific use cases and performance requirements. Whether you're building a dynamic web application, a static website, or something in between, understanding these methods is crucial for creating efficient and scalable React applications.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore six key approaches to data fetching in Next.js: Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Route Handlers (API Routes), and using TanStack React Query. We'll dive into the strengths of each method, provide code examples, and discuss ideal use cases to help you make informed decisions for your Next.js projects.

Let's begin our journey through the world of data fetching in Next.js!

## 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

SSR is great for dynamic content that needs to be fresh on every request.

```tsx
async function Page() {
	const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
	const data = await res.json()
	return <main>{/* Render data */}</main>
}
```

Best for:
- Pages with frequently changing data
- Content that needs to be personalized for each user
- Pages where SEO is crucial and content must be up-to-date
- Scenarios where you need access to request-specific information (e.g., cookies, headers)

Examples:
- Social media feeds
- Real-time dashboards
- E-commerce product pages with dynamic pricing or inventory

## 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)

SSG is perfect for static content that doesn't change often.

```tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
	// Generate or fetch array of page params
	return [{ id: '1' }, { id: '2' }, ...]
	}
	async function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
		const res = await fetch(https://api.example.com/data/${params.id})
		const data = await res.json()
		return <main>{/* Render data */}</main>
}
```

Best for:
- Content that doesn't change often
- Pages that are the same for all users
- Scenarios where performance and scalability are top priorities

Examples:
- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- Documentation sites
- Product catalogs with infrequent updates


## 3. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

ISR is a combination of SSG and SSR. It allows you to update static pages at specified intervals.

```tsx
async function Page() {
	const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', { next: { revalidate: 60 } })
	const data = await res.json()
	return <main>{/* Render data */}</main>
}
```
Best for:
- Pages with content that changes periodically but not in real-time
- High-traffic pages where you want to balance performance with data freshness
- Large sites with many pages that would be impractical to rebuild entirely

Examples:
- News websites
- E-commerce category pages
- Event listings that update daily or weekly

## 4. Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

CSR is useful for highly interactive components or when data is user-specific.
```tsx
'use client'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
function ClientComponent() {
	const [data, setData] = useState(null)
	useEffect(() => {
		fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
		.then(res => res.json())
		.then(setData)
		}, [])
		if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>
		return <div>{/* Render data */}</div>
}
```
Best for:
- Highly interactive components
- Data that is specific to the user and not needed for SEO
- Sections of a page that require frequent updates

Examples:
- User profiles
- Interactive data visualizations
- Real-time chat interfaces
- Complex form interactions

## 5. Route Handlers (API Routes)

Route Handlers are ideal for creating API endpoints within your Next.js app.
```tsx
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
export async function GET() {
	const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
	const data = await res.json()
	return NextResponse.json(data)
}
```
Best for:
- Creating backend API endpoints within your Next.js app
- Handling form submissions
- Integrating with external APIs securely

Examples:
- Authentication endpoints
- Webhook receivers
- Custom API endpoints for your frontend


## 6. TanStack React Query

For complex data fetching scenarios, TanStack React Query is recommended.
```tsx
'use client'
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
function QueryComponent() {
	const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
		queryKey: ['data'],
		queryFn: () =>
			fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
				.then((res) => res.json())
		})
	if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
	if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>
	return <div>{/* Render data */}</div>
}
```
Best for:
- Complex data fetching scenarios
- Managing server state on the client side
- Optimistic updates and real-time synchronization

Examples:
- Infinite scrolling lists
- Real-time collaborative features
- Caching and synchronizing data across multiple components

## Choosing the Right Method

When deciding which method to use, consider:

- **Data freshness**: How often does the data change?
- **Performance**: Do you need instant loading or is some delay acceptable?
- **User specificity**: Is the data the same for all users or personalized?
- **SEO requirements**: Does the content need to be indexed by search engines?

By understanding these factors and the strengths of each method, you can choose the most appropriate data fetching strategy for your Next.js application.

Remember, you can mix and match these methods within your app to optimize for different use cases. Happy coding!
