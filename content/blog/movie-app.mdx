- install Next.js and Supabase
- create lib folder to create client for Supabase

```
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);

```

- add Enviorment Variables

## Front End

- header design for dashboard
- implement search bar for movies
- needs debouncing

## Back End

- session based authentication

## 1st Attempt

- First attempt went ok, I am going to re attempt the project with server actions instead of however I did it last time
- Trying to do separations of concerns, server actions for the backend and client actions for the front end
