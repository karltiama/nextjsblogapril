		situation:"During my recent trip to Canada, I struggled to find an app that effectively combined mapping, photo integration, and journaling to document my journey. This inspired me to create my own travel mapping app â€“ a digital companion that plots routes and serves as an interactive journal. The app I envision would feature custom map markers, seamless photo integration, and detailed location notes, allowing travelers to capture the essence of their experiences. By developing it myself, I can tailor it to specific needs and include sharing capabilities for friends and family. This project not only allows me to expand my skills in web development and mapping technologies but could also evolve into a versatile tool for other travelers. Ultimately, it aims to transform how we remember and share travel experiences, turning each journey into a vivid, digital story.",
