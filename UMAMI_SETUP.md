# ðŸ“Š Umami Analytics Dashboard Setup

Your analytics dashboard now uses Umami's **Share URL** feature to display live analytics data without requiring API access!

## **ðŸŽ¯ Current Setup: Share URL Embed**

The analytics dashboard (`/analytics`) now embeds your Umami dashboard directly using the public share URL feature.

### **Step 1: Get Your Share URL**

1. Log into your Umami dashboard at **https://cloud.umami.is**
2. Click on your website in the dashboard
3. Click the **"Share"** button in the top right corner
4. Copy the generated share URL (it looks like `https://cloud.umami.is/share/xxx-xxx-xxx`)

### **Step 2: Update the Component**

Update the `shareUrl` prop in `/app/analytics/page.tsx`:

```tsx
<AnalyticsEmbed 
  shareUrl="YOUR_ACTUAL_SHARE_URL_HERE"
  websiteId="3d15d7a9-0fe1-4f42-9846-8e817013dd3d"
/>
```

### **Step 3: Test the Integration**

1. Run your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit **http://localhost:3000/analytics**

3. You should see:
   - âœ… Live analytics data embedded in an iframe
   - âœ… A button to open the full dashboard
   - âœ… Professional layout with your branding
